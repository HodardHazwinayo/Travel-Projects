# Tourism-Trend-Project
My biggest project yet. I seek to create and analyze databases of tourism metrics by city, region, and country, and find how they correlate with new developments.
The first code will be basic machine learning tools to experiment with functions that will then be used on a larger scale to analyze trends in global tourism
